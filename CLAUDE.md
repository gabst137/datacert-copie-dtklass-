Project Plan: Business Process Management App

This document outlines the recommended steps to build your application. We'll start with the foundation and progressively add more complex features.
Phase 1: The Foundation (Core Setup)

Goal: Get a basic, secure application running where users can sign up and log in.

    Frontend Framework: Choose a modern framework. React is an excellent choice due to its component-based architecture, which will make building your complex forms easier.

    Firebase Project Setup:

        Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

        Add a new Web App to your Firebase project.

        Copy the Firebase configuration object. You will need this for your React app.

    Authentication:

        In the Firebase Console, go to "Authentication" and enable the "Email/Password" sign-in method. This is the simplest way to start.

    Firestore Database:

        Go to the "Firestore Database" section and create a new database. Start in test mode for now to allow easy reading and writing. We will add security rules later.

Phase 2: Data Modeling & Core UI

Goal: Define how your data will be stored and build the main interface for managing projects and workflows.
Firestore Data Structure

A hierarchical (or nested) structure using collections and documents is perfect for your needs. Here is a recommended model:

    /companies/{companyId}/

        This document will hold information about the company/account.

        Fields: companyName, ownerUid, etc.

    /companies/{companyId}/projects/{projectId}/

        A subcollection for the company's departments (HR, Marketing, etc.).

        Fields: projectName, createdAt, etc.

    /companies/{companyId}/projects/{projectId}/flows/{flowId}/

        A subcollection for the different workflows within a project.

        Fields: flowName, flowDescription, approved, etc.

    /companies/{companyId}/projects/{projectId}/flows/{flowId}/formData/{submissionId}/

        A subcollection to store each form submission for a given flow.

        Fields: This will contain all the data from your dynamic forms. E.g., date, employeeName, submissionData: { ... }, etc.

User Interface (React Components)

    Dashboard Page: After logging in, the user sees a list of their "Projects" (e.g., Resurse Umane, Marketing).

    Project Page: Clicking a project takes them to a page listing the "Flows" (e.g., Recrutare, Salarizare).

    Flow Page: Clicking a flow opens the detailed form for data entry, as seen in your screenshots.

    Form Component: This will be your most complex component. You'll need to manage many input fields, dropdowns, and potentially dynamic sections.

Phase 3: Advanced Features

Goal: Implement the final output generation and templating.

    PDF/Flowchart Generation:

        PDFs: Use a library like jspdf and jspdf-autotable to generate PDF documents from the formData. You can create a "Generate PDF" button that takes the form data and formats it into a downloadable file.

        Flowcharts: For visual representations, a library like react-flow is excellent. It allows you to build node-based diagrams programmatically from your data.

    Templating:

        Create a new root collection in Firestore called /templates.

        Each document in /templates can define the structure of a form (e.g., the fields, their types, and layout).

        When a user creates a new "Flow," they can select a template, which will dynamically build the required form.

Your first step is to complete Phase 1. The App.jsx file I'm providing will give you a complete, working starting point for user authentication and creating/viewing projects.
